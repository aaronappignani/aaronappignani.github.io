                    This is my Olympus Infinity Zoom 70, which really kick-started my desire to pursue photography as my primary hobby/interest. Easily the best eBay purchase of my life.
                    This camera has a decently sharp lens compared to most film cameras of the time, and really excels when shooting black-and-white, or really low ISO film.
                    I typically use this for vacations or trips out of the town I live in, where the extra cost of film is justified.

                    This is my Canon PowerShot SX120IS. I bought it for $40 from a rich lady in Greenpoint in February of 2024.
                    I use this camera for video recording mostly -- it gives off that Emma Chamberlain "recorded in 4x3 and kinda grainy" vibe.
                    I sometimes use the microphone on this, since it actually works pretty well at getting that vintage camcorder style mic.

                    This is my Fujifilm FinePix A340. I bought this from a guy in Astoria who was in the process of retiring and becoming a snowbird. I hope he's doing well!
                    This is my "daily driver" camera of sorts -- If I'm randomly snapping a picture, it's probably with this camera.
                    I personally LOVE the saturated colors and the slightly cloudy/blurry vibe that it gives off.
                    Unfortunately, this doesn't take video at all.

                    My aunt gave me this Polaroid for Christmas of 2022! It works well, but isn't something that I use very often.
                    Polaroid film is just so expensive for the volume of shots you get to work with, especially compared to digital or even roll film.

                    I have had this microphone for years, and it works very well! I typically use it for recording any kind of voice-over stuff - even though my voice kind of sucks.
