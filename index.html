                    <p>This consists of all the film that I shot when I was either visiting or living in New York. All film was shot on my Olympus Infinity Zoom 70. <br>
                        What isn't pictured in these is how painfully broke I was at the time. <br>
                        As stated by every creative ever, New York is the best place in the world to get footage. I just tried to capture what I saw on the daily -- my day trips, my commute, my apartment, et cetera. <br>
                        All film was shot between December 2023 and September 2024.

                    <p>I've been living back in my home city for the past four months. It's unsettling and fascinating to see a place completely change in your lifetime, especially when it's objectively improving. <br>
                        I've been trying to capture scenes from it when I have the free time, especially of what it looks like at this moment in time - since I don't think it's going to stop changing, ever. <br><br>

            <h3>Olympus Infinity Zoom 70</h3>
            <p>
                    This is my Olympus Infinity Zoom 70, which really kick-started my desire to pursue photography as my primary hobby/interest. Easily the best eBay purchase of my life. <br>
                    This camera has a decently sharp lens compared to most film cameras of the time, and really excels when shooting black-and-white, or 200 ISO film. <br>
                    I typically use this for vacations or trips out of the town I live in, where the extra cost of film is justified. <br>

            <h3>Canon PowerShot SX120IS</h3>
            <p>
                This is my Canon PowerShot SX120IS. I bought it for $40 from a rich lady in Greenpoint in February of 2024. <br>
                I use this camera for video recording mostly -- it gives off that y2k, recorded in 4:3, 2006 YouTube video vibe. <br>
                I sometimes use the microphone on this, since it actually works pretty well at getting a specific, low-quality, home-video sound. <br>

            <h3>FujiFilm FinePix A340</h3>
            <p>
                This is my Fujifilm FinePix A340. I bought this from a guy in Astoria who was in the process of retiring and moving down South. I hope he's doing well! <br>
                This is my "daily driver" camera of sorts -- If I'm randomly snapping a picture, it's probably with this camera. <br>
                I personally LOVE the saturated colors and the slightly cloudy/blurry vibe that it gives off. It has a film-like quality, but in its own way entirely. <br>
                Unfortunately, this doesn't take video at all.

            <h3>Polaroid Now+</h3>
            <p>
                My aunt gave me this Polaroid for Christmas of 2022! It works well, but isn't something that I use very often. <br>
                Polaroid film is just so expensive for the volume of shots you get to work with, especially compared to digital or even regular 35mm roll film.

            <h3>Olympus FE-170</h3>
            <p>
                This is the first digital camera I ever bought -- and the first I ever broke. I purchased it on eBay in 2022, using it to take pictures of my friends when I was bartending their frat parties. <br>
                This camera is what got me into both digicams and photography as a whole. I would highly reccommend buying one of these, if they weren't like fifty dollars on eBay without the expensive and proprietary memory cards. <br>
                I also have some extremely grainy video from this camera.
